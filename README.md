# GJP

Deterministic intersection engine for c#, it does the complicated work for you like calculations but leaves things like how you separate two objects when they collide up to you.

Not very robust, but not specially confusing either... at least i think so.

Weird commit messages may come as i update this, but remember: it's the only way i can stay motivated, so it's for the worst but it's the only way.

# Guide

//TODO: put guide here because no one understands each other's code, we're all different people after all.

# Lacking features

- Object pooling, since computers hates deleting memory.

- Segmented motion for people that want to make fast objects.
